# holbertonschool-interview

This repository contains projects that help build self confidence in interview skills and keys to successful interviewing. Working through these projects I have gained a greater understanding of essential data structures (Hash Tables, Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Pointers, etc.), along with Recursion, Sorting Algorithms, and Time Complexity.


## Programming Languages
- Python

## Authors

#### Gunter Pearson:
I am currently studying Machine Learning at Holberton School in Tulsa, Oklahoma and will graduate in January 2022. While working through these projects I have found a passion in problem solving and a need for finding more and more efficient algorithms as I practice and prepare my skills for technical interviews.
